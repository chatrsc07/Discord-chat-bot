# Discord-chat-bot

This is my first project so it's not very good. 
This is the code for a discord bot that will talk to you. It uses the google bard api to respond to messages. There are some issues with the length of responces but they will be fixed. 
For this to work the bot will need all permissions in the "text permissions" coloum and "Read messages/View channels" in teh "Gneral Permissions" coloum.
